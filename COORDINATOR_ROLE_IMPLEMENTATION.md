### 2. Coordinator Role Permissions

#### ✅ **Allowed Features (Team-Restricted)**
- **Customers**: View and manage team's customers
- **Enquiries**: Handle team's customer enquiries
- **Complaints**: Manage team's customer complaints
- **Visits**: Track and manage team's field visits
- **Requirements**: Handle team's project requirements
- **Pricing**: Manage team's pricing information
- **Employees**: View and manage team members

- **Attendance**: No access to regular attendance tracking
- **Admin Settings**: No access to global system settings
- **Cross-Team Data**: Cannot access other teams' data

### 3. Navigation Structure for Coordinator

#### **Desktop Sidebar:**
```
Customers
├── Customers
├── Enquiries
└── Complaints

Sales
├── Visits
├── Requirements
└── Pricing

Employees
├── Employees
└── Expenses

Reports
├── Approvals
└── Reports
```

#### **Mobile Navigation:**
- Dashboard
- Visits
- Customers
- Requirements
- Complaints
- Pricing
- Approvals
- Enquiries

- Reports
- Live Locations

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### **Authentication Updates**
- Added Coordinator role detection in `dashboard-layout.tsx`
- Updated role display to show "Coordinator View"
- Enhanced role detection for Coordinator users

#### **Navigation Updates**
- **Dashboard Layout**: Updated to show Coordinator-specific navigation
- **Mobile Navigation**: Added Coordinator-specific mobile navigation items
- **Settings Access**: Coordinators cannot access global settings (restricted like Managers and HR)
- **Attendance Restriction**: Coordinators cannot access the regular attendance page

#### **Role-Based Access Control**
- Coordinators see all categories except HR functions and Attendance
- Team-based data filtering (inherited from existing team management logic)

- Attendance page includes redirect logic to prevent coordinator access

### 5. Role Hierarchy

```
Admin (Full Access)
├── All features including HR and Settings
└── Global system access

Coordinator (Team-Restricted)
├── All features except HR functions and Attendance
├── Team-based data access
└── No global settings access

Manager (Limited Sales Access)
├── Sales-focused features only

└── No HR or Settings access

HR (HR-Only Access)
├── Only HR functions (Salary, Attendance, Settings)
└── No sales or operational features

```

### 6. Data Filtering Strategy

#### **Team-Based Filtering**
- Coordinators inherit the same team-based filtering logic as Managers
- Data is filtered based on team membership
- Cannot access data from other teams

#### **API Integration**
- Uses existing team management APIs
- Leverages `API.getTeamByEmployee()` for team data
- Filters results based on team membership

### 7. UI/UX Features

#### **Role Indicators**
- Badge displays "Coordinator View"
- Consistent styling with other roles
- Clear role identification

#### **Navigation Experience**
- Full navigation menu (except HR functions)
- Mobile-optimized navigation
- Intuitive access to team management features

#### **Access Restrictions**
- Settings link hidden (same as Manager and HR)
- HR functions completely hidden
- Team-scoped data access

### 8. File Changes Summary

- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Added Coordinator page headings

#### **Key Changes:**
1. **Role Detection**: Added `isCoordinator` state and detection logic
2. **Navigation Filtering**: Coordinator gets all categories except HR functions
3. **Settings Restriction**: Coordinators cannot access global settings
4. **Role Display**: Shows "Coordinator View" badge
5. **Mobile Support**: Full mobile navigation for Coordinator features

### 9. Testing the Coordinator Role

#### **To Test Coordinator Functionality:**

1. **Create Coordinator User** (Backend):
   ```json
   {
     "username": "TeamCoordinator",
     "password": "Coord123",
     "roles": "ROLE_COORDINATOR"
   }
   ```

2. **Login with Coordinator Credentials**:
   - Coordinator users will see full navigation (except HR)
   - Badge displays "Coordinator View"
   - Access to all team management features

3. **Verify Access Control**:
   - ✅ Can access: Customers, Visits, Employees, Expenses, etc.
   - ❌ Cannot access: HR functions, Attendance, Global Settings
   - ✅ Team-based data filtering works correctly
   - ✅ Attempting to access Attendance redirects to Dashboard

### 10. Benefits of This Implementation

2. **Team Focus**: Data is properly scoped to their team
3. **Security**: Cannot access HR functions, Attendance, or global settings
4. **Consistency**: Follows same patterns as existing roles
5. **Scalability**: Easy to extend with additional coordinator features

### 11. Use Cases for Coordinator Role
